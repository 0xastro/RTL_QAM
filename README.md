# RTL_QAM
The project is designed using VHDL to realise the M-QAM modulation.
#### Design Software:  
- GHDL 
- Scansion
- Xilinx Vivado Webpack

#### System Modules
- Phase Accumlator
- Complex Mapper
- DDFS [Sinsoidal Oscillator [sin and cos] ]
- Integrator
- LFSR [Linear Phase Shift Register]
- LATCH [4069]

### TODO:
- Update the Phase Difference for both carriers
- [FIX] the addition process
- [ADD] GNURadio and Matlab TestFiles
- [ADD] Documentation
- [DO] Synthesis on Xilinx and Report the Utilized resources, the critical path, and the Maximum Operating Frequency.
- [Update] System Diagram
